    /// FINAL PROJECT: Creating a Small 3D Scene
    /// 
    /// 🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! 🎉
    /// You've completed the entire Mini Renderer course!
    /// 
    /// This final project brings together everything you've learned:
    /// 
    /// ✓ Module 1: Getting Started with OpenTK
    ///   - Window creation and OpenGL context setup
    ///   - Basic rendering pipeline understanding
    /// 
    /// ✓ Module 2: Understanding the Graphics Pipeline  
    ///   - Vertex and fragment shaders (GLSL)
    ///   - Rendering colored shapes
    /// 
    /// ✓ Module 3: 2D Rendering Basics
    ///   - 2D coordinate systems and transformations
    ///   - Textured sprites and basic 2D camera
    /// 
    /// ✓ Module 4: Expanding to 3D Rendering
    ///   - 3D coordinate systems and perspective projection
    ///   - 3D transformations (Model-View-Projection matrices)
    ///   - Wireframe and solid 3D objects
    /// 
    /// ✓ Module 5: Textures & Materials
    ///   - Loading and applying textures
    ///   - UV mapping and texture coordinates
    ///   - Basic material system
    /// 
    /// ✓ Module 6: Loading 3D Models
    ///   - OBJ file format parsing
    ///   - 3D model loading and rendering
    ///   - Texture application to models
    /// 
    /// ✓ Module 7: Lighting Basics
    ///   - Ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting
    ///   - Multiple light types (directional, point, spot)
    ///   - Material properties and lighting scenarios
    /// 
    /// ✓ Module 8: Building the Mini Renderer
    ///   - Scene management for multiple objects
    ///   - Performance optimizations (culling)
    ///   - Object organization and animation
    /// 
    /// FINAL PROJECT FEATURES:
    /// 🎮 Complete interactive 3D scene
    /// 💡 Advanced lighting with multiple scenarios
    /// 🎨 Material showcase with different surface properties
    /// 🏗️  Efficient scene management with performance monitoring
    /// ⚡ Real-time performance optimizations
    /// 📊 Educational statistics and monitoring
    /// 🎯 Scene presets for different demonstrations
    /// 
    /// WHAT YOU'VE LEARNED:
    /// - Modern OpenGL programming with C#
    /// - 3D graphics mathematics and transformations
    /// - Shader programming (GLSL)
    /// - Lighting models and material systems
    /// - 3D model loading and processing
    /// - Performance optimization techniques
    /// - Scene graph management
    /// - Interactive 3D application development
    /// 
    /// NEXT STEPS:
